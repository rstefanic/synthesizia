Synesthesia experienced through a synthesizer.

## About

I'm currently learning audio programming and I figured this would be a fun little program to learn the basics.

Using the 12 notes in a chromatic scale, each note corresponds to a color that will change the color of the window. The colors for each note are depicted below.

Notes can be played using the keys in the number row. Each number corresponds to a note.
